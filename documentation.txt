This assignment has been developed in c++ language.
The program is well commented.

Requirement 1 :

for each object display the variables before each keyframe and after each keyframe

 I made DisplayValueEachObject method which will print all the objects with values which has keyframes.
 
I have performed linear interpolation while reading the file and storing values in array.

To show values before keyframe started I made DisplayBeforeValueEachObject method.

Requirement 2:

if current keyframe number is largest than the largest keyframe of current object then I am showing object does not exist. Please check display method

Requirement 3:

You can give path to the application such as F:\Tushar\Animation\animation.txt
and you will see console displays the values and after animation will start.

Requirement 4:

For custom animation I have attached file Customanimation.txt. Please use it as input file to show customanimation.

Requirement 5:

I have handle errors as follows :

error 1: object ids in any order :

I am reading all the objects and giving them a unique Id in for loop. Hence it doesn't matter in which order they come.

error 2: keyframes for single object not together

I am reading all keyframes after all objects hence when keyframe reading started if keyframe belongs to object 1
 then I add it to the object where object id is 1 . 
 
error 3:  error if a time for a key frame is less than 

I am reading keyframes as specified in txt file. IF keyframe number for given object is
 larger than the current largest keyframe then I am printing the message. Please check processfile method.
I am also ignoring that keyframe.

error 4: Report an error if a key frame refers to a missing object.

I am checking if object exist while reading keyframe.


Please contact me if you find difficulty to run the program.
