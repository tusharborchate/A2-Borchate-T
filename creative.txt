Creative animation


to run creative animation you give customanimation.txt  as input file

1. There are three functionalities as a creative animation.

2. If you press f1 then only first two object will start the animation.

3. If you press f2 then all objects will start the animation.

4. If you press f3 then all objects will start animation + camera position get changed.

I am counting frames for per update and after then reading all keyframes its stop.
I have created special function of opengl to handle keyboard functionality.
if you press f1 frames counter gets 0 and animation starts again but I put constraint that only first two objects will show animation.

if you press f2 frames counter gets 0 and animation starts again but I put constraint that only first three objects will show animation.

if you press f3 frames counter gets 0 and animation starts again and all objects wil show animation. The camera will also changes its position.

//for all frames
		for (size_t f = frames; f <= frames; f++)
		{
			if (f > 80 && customanimation == true && restartf1 == true)
			{
				camx = camx + 1;
				camy = camy + 5;
				camz = camz + 1;
			}
			if (f > 120 && customanimation == true && restartf1 == true)
			{
				camx = camx - 1;
				camy = camx - 15;
				camz = camz - 10;

			}
			
			Please check this code in display method.
			
			

Thanks. :)
